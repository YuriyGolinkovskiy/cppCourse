SHAKE-SPEARES    SONNETS    Neuer before Imprinted        AT LONDON    By G.Eld for T.T. and are    to be ?olde by William A?pley.    1609.Approximate Facsimile of Title page of Shakespeare’s Sonnets. 1       as an item of great moment. Yet were it not for the publication of this work, there would be extant only two of Shakespeare’s sonnets, 138 and 144, neither of which are thought to be among his best and most memorable. 2  We therefore are indebted to the publisher of this book for bringing to light an incomparable series of poems which has no equal in world literature. It has been claimed that the work is a pirated edition, and that Thomas Thorpe, the publisher, obtained his copy by theft or subterfuge. If that is so, then even as a pirate or a thief we still owe him a debt of gratitude, for it is not at all evident that the poems would otherwise have been published. The First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s plays, published by Heminge and Condell in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare’s death, did not include his poems. As fellow actors and theatre owners, they were mainly interested in his plays, and the narrative poems had already been printed in Shakespeare’s lifetime. There was therefore no need to add anything extra or extraneous to the First Folio, which was in itself a sufficiently costly undertaking.    We rely entirely upon the 1609 Quarto edition published by Thomas Thorpe for our knowledge of the sonnets. In those days there were no copyright laws to protect authors. They were dependent upon their own wits and the assistance of entrepreneurs in the printing world, members of the Stationers Company, for getting their works published and for obtaining any income from those works. Such laws as existed were used to protect the Stationers from predation by other publishers.    There is no reason to suppose that Shakespeare resolved that his sonnets should not be published. It would indeed be strange if the man who could write    Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade  W hen in eternal lines to time thou growest. 18.11-12.    and    Your monument shall be my gentle verse,  Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,  And tongues to be your being shall rehearse  When all the breathers of this world are dead; 81. 9-12.      should consider it a matter of indifference if those lines were never seen or published or read and were in no sense eternal. Of course we may ascribe such sentiments to the exaggerated hyperbole of the sonnet form, ‘a poet’s rage, and stretched metre of an antique song’, and it has been fashionable from the Romantic period onwards to think of Shakespeare as the sublime inspired poet writing immortal lines, but not in the least concerned whether his words should survive his own demise. Yet there is ample evidence to show that he was not such a man, that he was very practical, concerned with establishing his position in society, and concerned that his family name should continue after his death. His will alone is enough to establish this point, with its detailed conditional bestowal of assets down to the possible sixth and seventh sons of his daughter Susannah and to their heirs. 3     Shakespeare clearly was not averse to having his works published. His Venus and Adonis ran through many editions. His narrative poem The Rape of Lucrece he also published, with a fulsome dedication to the Earl of Southampton. The fact that many of his plays were not published in his lifetime may have many explanations. They were among the most popular plays of the period and were frequently performed, so that they had a wide audience already. Publication might have diluted this audience, or indeed made the works available to rival companies. The author was perhaps too busy to arrange the awkward business of publication. It is always possible that he did contemplate a complete edition of his works, such as that which Ben Jonson managed to achieve, but perhaps work and illness and an untimely death prevented him. These are of course all conjectures, but we should not take the absence of evidence about Shakespeare’s publishing intentions to be indicative that he did not wish to have his Sonnets published. The main basis for the claim that the work was pirated has always been that there is something unsavoury in the subject matter of the poems. Nearly three quarters of the 154 sonnets are addressed to a man. The remaining ones mostly describe rather lurid episodes in his infatuation for a dark woman, the so called ‘dark lady’ of the sonnets. The final poem in the book, A Lover’s Complaint, has in the past been more or less sidelined and not discussed in relation to the sonnets at all. 4     However, setting aside the supposedly unsavoury nature of the work, (which I shall deal with later), there is strong internal evidence that the Sonnets were carefully prepared for publication. In the first place there is the tripartite division of the work. The first group of sonnets, 1 - 126 are addressed to a man. They are sonnets mostly of pure love and devotion, marred by the fact that the beloved fair youth does not correspond to the ideal which the poet has created of love and the loved object, and also marred by the poet’s occasional failure to live up to the ideal of love as he envisages it. The second group, 127 – 152, describes his love, or perhaps infatuation for his dark mistress. The love shown in these poems is tainted and distorted by sexual attraction. The poet laments that his mistress has such power over him. Two Anacreontic sonnets conclude the sequence. Finally the work is rounded off by a poem describing love betrayed, A Lover’s Complaint. In this case it is a young woman’s love for a man which is portrayed, but the woman is cruelly seduced and abandoned by the man, whose sole purpose from the outset was sexual conquest.    This division into three main parts corresponds with many other sonnet sequences published in the period, such as Daniel’s Delia, Lodge’s Phillis – and Spenser’s Amoretti. 5  It may seem strange to modern taste, but it was not unusual at the time. In any case there is a notable harmonious relationship between the three sections, characterised broadly by their themes, as follows. Pure love:    Let me not to the marriage of true minds  Admit impediments. 116. 1-2.    Tainted love:    When my love swears that she is made of truth  I do believe her though I know she lies. 138. 1-2.    Love betrayed but redeemed by sacrifice:    Ay me! I fell, and yet do question make  What I would do again for such a sake. LC. 321-2.    Or we may see it as depicting and contrasting love between a man and a man, a man and a woman, a woman and a man.    There are other strands woven into the poems, particularly the religious references, which occur so frequently that they cannot be ignored, and which suggest that we could interpret them also on a secondary or tertiary level. The three sections could divide into, for example, the true church, the false harlot church, the church betrayed or betraying. These are not rigid categories, but they are suggested by the language of the sonnets, as I hope to show subsequently, and they do indicate a high degree of thought and preparation in the organisation of the sequence.    Aside from this there is also to be considered the placing of individual sonnets in significant positions in the sequence, such as 1, the carefully composed introductory sonnet; 12 - the twelve hours of the day; 52 – the weeks of the long year, 60 - the sixty minutes of the hour, 104 - perhaps a dating sonnet for the year 1604; 126, with its two blank lines bringing the first part of the sequence to an end; the climacteric sonnets 49 and 63. And 101 which I discuss later as a possible dating reference for the year 1601. All this bears not the stamp of some hastily cobbled together ill matched group of sonnets, but carries with it a sense of ordering and structure which has been carefully thought out and applied. No attempt at re-ordering the sequence of the sonnets has ever been successful and there is no evidence to suggest that this is not the sequence which Shakespeare intended.    Internally therefore there appears to be strong evidence for regarding the Sonnets as being presented in the sequence and arrangement that Shakespeare had intended for them. External and independent evidence for the proposition that the work was pirated seems to depend on a dislike of the subject matter and the fact that piracy in the publishing world was not uncommon. Possibly some of the Quarto editions of the plays were stolen versions, although without direct documentary evidence by way of protests or apologies it is impossible to be certain which were the unauthorised editions, and which were not. Our deductions are based mainly on the quality of the text of the various Quarto editions, not on external factors. It is of course possible that this is an edition of the Sonnets as Shakespeare intended it to be, but that it is stolen copy and Thomas Thorpe is the rascal publisher who stepped in between the publication and Shakespeare’s hopes. In which case we may malign Thorpe to our heart’s content, but it hardly makes any difference, for we have what we desire, the Sonnets as Shakespeare intended them to be seen. One has to consider also the additional fact that the book was entered in the Stationer’s Register for 1609 in an entirely normal manner. If Thorpe was a pariah in the publishing world it might have been difficult for him to have managed this.    But there is yet one further stumbling block in our attempts to free the Sonnets from the attaint of stolen property, namely the enigmatic dedication which is prefixed to them. Many have interpreted the wording of this dedication as evidence that the work was unauthorised. In particular they seize on the phrase ‘the onlie begetter of these insuing sonnets’ as pointing to something surreptitiously acquired or to someone filching a manuscript or aiding another to obtain it. And there is no doubt that the dedication is puzzling and perhaps deliberately misleading. Here it is in full. 6
